I had this word in my vocabulary for quite some time but I never used it in my expression as I didn't understand what it feels to have an epiphany until today. Today I had this feeling of longing towards someone who had drifted apart from me. The feeling of sharing a walk. A walk down a road with a cup of coffee at night and listen to each other, hum a song, hold hands or simply just walk until it's 10:45 p.m. I guess the cupcakes which she sent are messing with my head.

I reminisce about the memories we created, just the good ones. Bad memories seem to have faded for some reason or the other. I hope that the good ones fade away too as there's no point lingering in the memory lane where nothing waits for you but pain.

I learned it the hard way that it's the feeling of being special for your partner is what keeps you together. It's funny how the definition of _special_ changes as we grow up. There was a time when my new pencil box was special to me. Now that pencil box is nowhere to be found as it's no longer special. Special is just a placeholder. Merely tagging something or someone special does not make them special but the actions that you do for them. So if you are feeling less special, that means either their actions are not enough or your actions are not being appreciated enough.

Now that the sense of being special is gone, I constantly find myself distracted and restless. I guess it will take a while before I get used to not being special for her. Maybe we could have done things differently so that things would have worked out between us. But I guess everything happens for a reason as I have a strong belief in "Butterfly Effect".

Now we are just waiting for the dust to settle and when it does, maybe we'll move on in life with a new perspective.

This phase was one of the hardest I've ever faced but from the ashes of the past, I hope to rise and be more resilient to the blows waiting in my path to knock me down.
